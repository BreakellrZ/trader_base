# ***TraderBase - Colin Breakell - Portfolio Project 4 ***

- TraderBase is a website for Forex traders who would like to follow along with a Funded ICT Trader. I decided to make this website for all ICT traders out there who would like to gain information and knowledge, while following my journey via a Journal blog. In my Journal I will be providing daily and weekly analysis. Each blog post will contain chart examples and text explaining what my thought proccess is for each day and each week. I will be showing trade examples, useful information, and trading models for users who signup. I wanted to give a 'Money Heist' vibe to my website beacuse I believe trading is like a money heist. We are entering the market ready to start a heist and take money out of the market for ourselves.

**MoSCoW prioritization technique stands for**:

**Must-Have**: Critical requirements that must be implemented for the project to be considered successful.

**Should-Have**: Important requirements that are not critical but add significant value.

**Could-Haves**: Desirable features that would be nice to have but are not crucial.

**Won't-Have**: Features that are explicitly excluded from the project scope.
