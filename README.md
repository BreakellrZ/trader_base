# ***TraderBase - Colin Breakell - Portfolio Project 4***

- TraderBase is a website for Forex traders who would like to follow along with a Funded ICT Trader. I decided to make this website for all ICT traders out there who would like to gain information and knowledge, while following my journey via a Journal blog. In my Journal I will be providing daily and weekly analysis. (ICT trading is a style of trading from a trader called ICT) Each blog post will contain chart examples and text explaining what my thought proccess is for each day and each week. I will be showing trade examples, useful information, and trading models for users who signup. I wanted to give a 'Money Heist' vibe to my website beacuse I believe trading is like a money heist. We are entering the market ready to start a heist and take money out of the market for ourselves. Alongside the Journal, there is a checklist feature for all users who have signed up. This checklist is to be used for your trades. Each user has their own indivdual checklist they can use. All users have to do is go to the checklist page, and enter in what they believe needs to be checked off before they enter a trade.

# **3. User Experience (UX)**

## **3.1. The Strategy Plane**

### **3.1.1 The Idea**
The idea for TraderBase is simple. I wanted a website that allowed like minded Traders to be able to view my analysis for free. A place for ICT traders to learn some trading education and to compare there analysis to mine. My idea was for me to post Journal entries - these Journal entries would involve weekly, and daily analsyis. People can sign up and view my Journal entires and hopefully learn something!

### **3.1.2 The Ideal User**
My target audience is like minded traders.

- Ideal user likes Forex Trading 
- Ideal user like Indices trading
- Ideal user likes ICT style of content and analysis


### **3.1.3 Site Goals**
- Offer users the ability to learn from my analysis 
- Allow users to view my Journal entries in a clear and easy to read way
- Allow users to ask questions via a comment section
- Get users to use the  Traders checklist to help them organize their trades with a list of things that should happen on the charts before they enter a trade.


### **3.1.4 Epics**
After thinking about my project, 8 Epics were created for this project. These Epics were the main sections of the TraderBase project. You can view the Epics via the KanBan board for this project. The Epics consisted of :

- EPIC 1 : Getting started/Organization
- EPIC 2 : User Authentication and Authorization
- EPIC 3 : App Creation
- EPIC 4 : Database Models
- EPIC 5 : Trading Journal 
- EPIC 6 : User Interaction on Posts 
- EPIC 7 : Style and Design of UI
- EPIC 8 : Documentation


 - ![Epics](documentation/epics.png)

### **3.1.5 User stories**

I had a total of 31 User Stoires for this project. I categorized them via Must-Have -- Should-have -- Could have -- & Wont have.
Must haves were Crucial for this project. Should-haves were I should have this but it is not the end of the world if I do not. Could haves were if I thought something could be in my project, It would be nice to have it but it does not need it. Wont haves were user stories that I wont have in my project due to time restraints or the skills to be able to do it as of now.

**MoSCoW prioritization technique stands for**:

**Must-Have**: Critical requirements that must be implemented for the project to be considered successful.

**Should-Have**: Important requirements that are not critical but add significant value.

**Could-Haves**: Desirable features that would be nice to have but are not crucial.

**Won't-Have**: Features that are explicitly excluded from the project scope.

**I used T-shirt sizing for comparative sizing rather than actual story points, I felt this was a better way visually for me as it was just myself working on this project. These ranged from small to xtra large for each User Story.**

## **3.2. The Scope Plane**

The scope plans contained the following features to be added.

### 3.2.1. Features to be implemented

- **User Authentication** : Users can Register, Login and Logout.

- **User Interaction for comments** : Users can interact with Journal entries via Comments.

- **User Interaction via checklist** : Users can use a checklist to organize their trades.

- **FAQ** : Users can view the FAQ accordian for answers to the most asked questions about TraderBase.

- **Notifications** : Users will be notified if they have commented on a post, deleted a post, updated a post & they will be able to see if they are logged in or not.


## **3.3. The Structure Plane**

**The structure of TraderBase is consistent, predictable, learnable, and visible, all in the best way using Bootstrap for styling and layout.**

It involves a clean header at the top of the page with the TraderBase logo to the left and the navbar links to the right. The footer is at the bottom of the page, it is clean, provoding users with a Telegram link for more trades from me, and also a disclamier to users that all content shown is not financial advice.

Then on the Home page we have a lovely hero image with text filling up the full screen. As the user scrools down there is another two sections, one with cards showcasing what the users can expect from TraderBase, and the last section is a FAQ area.

On the Journal page, we have the same Header and footer. The main section then involves a hero image and my Journal entry blog posts via cards. These cards are evenly spaced out and there is a Next and Previous buttons to press to go through the Journal entires. These buttons are structured just below the cards.

Inside the journal entries we have the title shown, then under we have the watchlists and news events for this Journal entry, below that we have the main post content and then a comment section for users to interact with the posts. Comments are shown on the left while the comment form is structured on the right. Header and Footer are the same on all pages.

Lastly we have the checklist page, with an update and delete page. All are stuctured very similar. Same Navbar and footer as all othe pages, and a main section in the middle of the page with forms for each page.

The headers structure changes based on if the user is logged in or not. If logged in it will show 'JOURNAL', 'CHECKLIST' & 'LOGOUT'. If not logged in it will show 'LOGIN' & 'REGISTER'.

### **Database Schemas** ###
#### **The database schema for TraderBase includes the following models:** ####

- **The User model** which stores all user information. 
This was already pre-built by django using 'from django.contrib.auth.models import User' in models.py. From looking at the django documentation I can see the fields include: Username, first_name, last_name, email, password, groups, user_permissions, is_staff, is_active, is_superuser, last_login, date_joined.

- **The Journal model** which stores data for each of my journal posts.
The fields involved here are - Author which is linked to the user model, title: for the title of each Journal post, content: for the main part of my Journal entry, date, status: to see if the Journal post is approved for posting, excerpt: users see a little sneak peak of what the Journal entry is all about, watchlist: a watchlist of which currencies we will be talking about in each Journal post, news_events and news: News_events involves which specific news event is involved in each Journal post and news is to tell users if there was high impact, medium impact, or no news for each Journal post. A cloudinary chart_image: For images of charts.

- **The Comment model** to store data for users comments:
The comment model involves - post: which is to connect to the Journal specific post to comment on, Author: which links the comment to the specific user who is commenting, body: which is the text that goes into the body of the comment, approved: Comments need to be approved to be posted, and created_on to make sure the newest comments are filtered to be posted at the top of the comment section.

- **The Checkbox model** to store data for the checklist feature:
The fields for the checklist are as follows - title: for the input char field so users can add new inputs to add to their checklist, slug, complete: this is used so users can check of their checklist inputs by clicking the complete button and it will store that the input is complete and show a strike on through that specific input on the frontend for users to see. created: the newest inputs will be on top, author: Foreignkey connect to user, this is used so that each user sees their own individual checklist and each new input is stored to their specific checklist.

## **3.5. The Surface Plane**
I went for a 'Money heist' theme for the surface plane. I used a lot of Money Hiest pictures for the hero images on the home page and Journal page and also for the cards on the home page. (Sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). All free images to use).
The reason for this type of design was because I felt like it fits into the trading theme. People Trade to make money and to get rich. To break free from the 'RatRace'. Money heist brings this vibe. Money Hiest is a spanish TV show based on robbers robbing a bank, getting their money and leaving. Just like the trading Markets people take a risk, enter the market, get there money and leave.

 I used was from Font Awesome. It is a icon of a money note with an up arrow indicating money growth. I used a straight line between the icon and the text 'Traderbase'. 
 
 ![Icon](/documentation/logo.png)

- *Color Pallette* :
 The main colors I used were blue, white, black, green, and red. These colors were all used using bootstraps color classes.
Text was either black or white. Giving it a clean aesthetic. I used Blue for the main words, like the name of the website 'TraderBase', the names of the Journal entires on the cards, and the title of the Journal entry. Green was used sparingly, mainly to show users some sort of notification such as if they are logged in or not, or if they have deleted a comment or edited a comment they would get it shown in green text. I used green here so it would stand out to the user. Red was only used for delete buttons, to show users that their comments will be waiting for approval, and to let users know this website is not financial advice as these are all very important for the users to see. (Shown left hand side of the footer)

- *Images* :
 Images were a big part of this project. As said previously I tried to stick with a money heist theme for all my images. I wanted to give a Rebellious vibe to this project. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

# **4. Features**

**There was numerous features to impliment in this project. Here is a full rundown of all the features:**

#### **Header** #### 
- The header was incorporated using Bootstrap. It contains the TraderBase logo on the left hand-side, along with the links to various pages on the right hand-side. Depending if users are logged in or not, certain links will be shown and certain links will not be shown. Home, signup, and login are shown when users are not logged in. Home, Journal, Checklist, and logout are shown if users are signed in.

![HEADER](/documentation/header_pp4.png)

#### **Footer** #### 
- The footer is at the bottom of each page. It consists of a warning letting people know this is not real financial advice, a traderbase copyright symbol, and a link for users to follow me on Telgram for more trade ideas. It has a white background like the header. 

![Footer](/documentation/footer_pp4.png)

#### **Favicon** #### 
- I used a money heist favicon to fit the theme. This is to show users that they are on the TraderBase website if they have a lot of tabs open.

![Favicon](/documentation/favicon.png)

#### **Landing page** #### 
- The landing page is to give users a clear indication of to what this website is all about. A big clear Welcome to traderbase message on the landing page along with some text to provide users with knowledge as to what this website provides.

![Landing page](/documentation/lading_page.png)


#### **Pop up message : Lets users know if they are logged in or not** #### 
- The pop up messages are used a number of times in this website. Messages appear on the landing page, journal page, and checklist page. This will either tell users if they are logged in or not, or they will also pop up when users post a comment, update or delete a comment, input something new for their checklist, and if they update or delete something on their checklists.

![Pop up messages](/documentation/pop_up_checklist.png)

![Pop up messages](/documentation/pop_up_message.png)

#### **What to expect** #### 
- Here we have a what to expect feature. This area of the home page provides users with what they should expect from the TraderBase website. Cards were used for these along with text for users to read.

![What to expect](/documentation/what_to_expect.png)

#### **FAQ** #### 
- Next we have our FAQ feature. An accordian is used here with bootstap for our faq section. Three big questions are asked and answered for our users,

![FAQ](/documentation/faq_feature.png)


#### **Journal - Next/Previous buttons/ View Journal entry features** #### 
- Our Journal feature is next. On the Journal page you can see a list of Journal entries from me that have been looped through. Users can see three Journal entries and then can click 'Next' to see paginate through the Journal entries. 'Next' and 'previous' buttons are used here to go back and fort between Journal entries. Once a user clicks on a Journal entry via the 'view Journal Entry button' it will take them to the post_detail.html page where they will see the Journal entrys content.

![Journal feature](/documentation/journal_feature.png)


#### **Journal details/content** #### 
- The Journal page consits of a title, watchlist, type of news, and what exact news. Then comes the main content of the Journal entry, alongside a picture of a chart for users to see. 

![Journal entry](/documentation/journal_feature_entry.png)

#### **Post_detail/Journal entry comment** #### 
- In our Journal entries, users can view comments, and comment on each individual posts. If a user comments, they have to wait for approval by the admin of the site. They are notifed of this. Users can also Edit their comment and Delete their comments. This will be notified to them also.

![](/documentation/comment_feature.png)


#### **Modal pop up for comment deletion** #### 
- If users decide they want to delete their comments, once they click the delete button a modal will pop up asking users if they are sure that they want to delete their comment.

![](/documentation/delete_comment_modal.png)



#### **Checklist input** #### 
- The checklist feature is for users to input a list of protocols that they should check off before entering a trade.
There is an input field for users to add whichever protocol they want to add to their checklist. Each cehcklist is individual for each user.

![Checklist](/documentation/trade_checklist_feature.png)

#### **Checklist update/delete** #### 
- Users can update and delete their protocols inside their checklists. There is an update and delete button for each input they do. Users are taking to an update input field if they click update, and a delete page to make sure they want to delete said input.

![Update Delete feature](/documentation/update_delete_feature.png)

![Update feature](/documentation/update_feature.png)

![Delete feature](/documentation/delete_feature.png)


#### **Strike through completed checklist inputs** #### 
- If users have ticked off one of there inputs, a strike will be put through that input to show users they have checked that protocol off.

![Strike through checked off inputs](/documentation/checked_off_checklist_feature.png)

#### **Signup** #### 
- Signup feature is used for users to sign up. They need to input the correct details or they will get errors and wont be able to sign up. This is all done by using 'allauth'.

![](/documentation/sign_up_feature.png)


#### **Login** #### 
- Users can login via login form. Done using 'allauth'.

![](/documentation/login_feature.png)


#### **Logout** #### 
- Users can logout via logout form. Done using 'allauth'.

![](/documentation/logout_feature.png)


## **4.1. Future Features**
I have a lot of Ideas for future features for TraderBase. My main two ideas include :

- An api that links a calender of all the high impact news events for users to see such as - [ForexFactory](https://www.forexfactory.com/)

-  A chat room for all users to chat and share Trade ideas with eachother.

## **5.3. Bugs**
 There was some bugs throughout creating my project. Some of these bugs were basic errors such as not turning debug on or off.
Others were more complex.

- One bug involved buttons on top of my hero images. At one stage during development buttons and anchors stopped working and were not clickable for me in sections where I included styles to a hero image. I realised this was a z-index issue. For my hero images to blend in to the background I had to use a z-index of -1 as part of my styling. This caused an issue with the buttons and anchor tags in that section. I had to style buttons and anchor tags on their own and change their z-index for them to function correctly again. 
<details>
<summary> Z-index button & anchor tags bug </summary>

![Z-index bug](documentation/z-index_bug.png)
</details>


- Server 500 error when Deployed to Heroku. I kept getting a server 500 error when I deployed to Heroku and treid to open my post_detail.html Journal entries. After some help I realised that I did not add my cloudinary URL to config vars in Heroku settings and the images I was uploading was not being registered by Heroku.
<details>
<summary> Server 500 bug</summary>

![Server 500 error](documentation/value_error_bug.png)
</details>

- For the checklist, It took me a while to figure out a bug as to why the checklist was not seperate for each individual user. I tried using checklist = Checkbox.objects.filter(author=request.user) in my Checklist function, which was correct but I needed to not save and commit the changes for all users, it needed to be for each individual user. I did this by using - 
    if form.is_valid():
        checkbox = form.save(commit=False)
        checkbox.author = request.user
        checkbox.save()

- There was a couple of erros/bugs found during the html validation. One of these was for the post_detail page. I was getting 'Error: Attribute comment_id not allowed on element button at this point.' for each comment that was registered. **Explain THISSSSS**
<details>
<summary> Error: Attribute comment_id not allowed on element button at this point</summary>
